In this practice, the intention is to use your knowledge in image processing to segment the faces of people and follow them through a camera connected by USB to your computer. For this, you must have the right hardware (Sony model EVI d100p), and then implement the logic that performs the segmentation of a face and an algorithm that collects that data and transforms it into orders for the camera's actuators, which must follow the movement of the person.
