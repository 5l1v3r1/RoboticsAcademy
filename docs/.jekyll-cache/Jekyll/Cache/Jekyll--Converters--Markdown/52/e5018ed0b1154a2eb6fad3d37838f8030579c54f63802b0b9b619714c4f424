I"°<p>In this practice the intention is to develop a color filter that allow us to segment some object in the image. You will have to get in contact with RGB and HSV color spaces, and OpenCV (python) library.</p>

<figure class=" ">
  
    
      <a href="/images/color_filter.png">
        <img src="/images/color_filter.png" alt="placeholder image 1" />
      </a>
    
  
  
    <figcaption>Color Filter.

</figure>

<p>For the realization of the practice, you are provided of a framework written in python that collects the images and allows its visualization. These images will be collected through several specific videos for this practice (pelota_roja.avi and pelotas_roja_azul.avi), although you could use your own videos instead or even a camera..</p>
