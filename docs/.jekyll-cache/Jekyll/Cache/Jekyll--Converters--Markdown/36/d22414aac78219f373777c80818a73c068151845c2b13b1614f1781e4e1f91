I"¡<p>The objective of this practice is to implement the logic of the VFF navigation algorithm.</p>

<p>Navigation using VFF (Virtual Force Field), consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each object in the environment generates a repulsive force towards the robot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destiny generates an attractive force in the robot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it possible for the robot to go towards the target, distancing itself of the obstacles, so that their address is the vector sum of all the forces.</p>

<p>The solution can integrate one or more of the following levels of difficulty, as well as any other one that occurs to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go as quickly as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose the safest way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obstacles in movement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robustness in situations of indecision (zero vector sum)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
